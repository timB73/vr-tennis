# VR Tennis Simulation with Sensory Misalignment

Virtual reality technology has significantly improved over the last decade. This project
explores using virtual reality to create a tennis simulation, including a real racket and
ball to create a greater sense of immersion. The project also explores the limits of using
misalignment techniques to enable a wider range of training scenarios, creating the illusion
of hitting a ball in different points in space.

## How to use

The project was built and tested using an Oculus Quest 2. However it makes use of the XR Interaction Toolkit, so it may be possible to use on other headsets as well. It uses a real racket which the right controller is attached to and a ball suspended on a string as a hit target.

The project can be configured from the Redirect script which can be found on the Misalignment component under the XRRig. Here you can adjust the button distance as well as tell the system whether to do a forehand or backhand.
